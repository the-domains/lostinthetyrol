Among "biggies" like Helsinki, Istanbul, Berlin and Amsterdam, Innsbruck (!) is being recommended as one of the 10 hottest travel destinations in Europe by CNN. And here's what they have to say about our little beauty:

'The Austrian capital may steal the spotlight from the rest of the country -- let's face it, Vienna is one beautiful city -- but Innsbruck deserves a place in the sun. Encircled by the Alps, the city offers the ultimate access to some of Europe's best ski fields: hop on a funicular in town, zip past jaw-dropping railway stations designed by Zaha Hadid and you'll find yourself flying down untrammeled snow in no time. Visit early in the year and you'll share the slopes with the world's snowboarding elite for the 20th edition of the [Billabong Air & Style][0] (February 1-2).White stuff aside, Innsbruck offers equal allure during its warmer months, when visitors jump on bikes and cycle between historic hillside towns. '

We couldn't agree more: Innsbruck DOES deserve 'a place in the sun' AND your visit ...  ;) . Check out our [eco-friendly Innsbruck guide][1]and find some fabulous green hotels around the region [here][2].
